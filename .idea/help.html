<h1>Sensor network generator</h1>
<h2>User manual</h2>
This tool allows you to visualize sensor network coverage.

<h3>Loading data</h3>
To load data select the "Choose File" button. Browse for the file you wish to load and select "Open". Files must be in
CSV format with the column headers: LocationID, xf, yf. LocationID is a string containing the label of the node while xf
and yf refer to the actual node locations.

<h3>Saving data</h3>
To save your work select the "Save" button. You will be prompted to save the node locations along with several additional
files containing information on the generated complexes. File naming must be consistent. You may name the primary file
whatever you like but the supporting file names must not be changed or else they will not load.

<h3>Random data generation</h3>
You may generate a set of randomly distributed nodes by selecting the "Generate random data" button. Enter the number of
desired nodes in the "# sensors" box up to 250. Note that selecting a number of nodes greater than approximately ~150 will
slow down all computations.

<h3>Data Editing</h3>

<p>
    <b>Moving nodes.</b> To move a node simply drag and drop. The location and coverage circle will move along with the mouse.
    After you have dropped the node into the new location the complex will be recalculated and rendered.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Deleting nodes.</b> To delete a node click once on any node location. The selected node will be highlighted. To delete
    the node press the "Delete" key on your keyboard. The node will be deleted and the complex will be updated. To cancel,
    press the "Escape" key.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Adding nodes.</b> To add a new node simply press the "Add node" button. The cursor will change to a crosshair. Click the
    desired location and the new node will be inserted and the complex updated.
</p>

<h3>Changing coverage radius.</h3>

Dragging the "Radius" slider will dynamically change the coverage radius for all nodes and update the complex accordingly.

<h3>View options</h3>
There are several options for visualizing network coverage. To add or remove each layer from the canvas simply toggle
the corresponding checkbox.

<p>
    <b>Nodes</b> correspond to sensor locations. Hovering over a node will
    highlight the coverage radius for that individual sensor.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Edges</b> correspond to the lines connecting each node. An edge only exists if the coverage radii overlap for two nodes.
    Hovering over an edge will highlight the edge and its corresponding nodes.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Faces</b> correspond to filled triangles indicating where three points are mutually connected. Hovering over a face
    will highlight the face along with the corresponding three points and edges that form the triangle. The presence of a face
    depends on which complex type you select:
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>&#268;ech</b> pertains to a simplicial complex constructed such that where the coverage for each of the three nodes overlaps,
    we can guarantee "good" coverage and represent this geometric area as a face or 2-simplex in topological space. (
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cech_cohomology">Reference</a>)
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Vietoris-Rips</b> is another, less computationally expensive way of calculating coverage. In this simplicial complex, faces
    are generated when 3 points are all pairwise within range of each other with no requirement that all three nodes simultaneously overlap.
    The advantage of this over the &#268;ech complex is that it is computationally much less expensive. The disadvantage lies in the fact that
    there is the possibility of small coverage gaps within each face where the coverage radii do not all intersect the circumcenter of the resulting triangle
    in geometric space. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex">Reference</a>)
